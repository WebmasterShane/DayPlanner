# DayPlanner


Unfortunatly i was not able to complete the assignment. I was able to make great progress, but i had to leave town for work related things before i was able to finish.
i am how ever happy with how far i got.

things i would have liked to do

-a more complete README
-Refract the code that pushs to local storage and retrives to data with a for loop and a var i
-Reference a .js document rather than having the script in the base HTML
-The Planner still doesnt change the input values to follow the time
